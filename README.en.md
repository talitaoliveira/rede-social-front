## The application

In this application you can find some social actions / projects. Where many rely on contributions and volunteers to stay active and continue to contribute to society in some way.

In each project you will find a description and ways to get in touch with them, be it by Instagram, Facebook, Website ..

The name **"Rede-Social"** it means Social Network, is because in this application have (or must have) several social projects registered with the necessary information about them.

## The project

This project is a **progressive wep app (PWA)** using webpack, ReactJS, service worker, manifest.js.

Back end of this project in this other repository: https://github.com/talitaoliveira/rede-social-back


In the first access to the projects the application already caches the data and files required for offline operation. With the possibility of being able to add it to your android home screen.
</p>

Soon I will post how to contribute ..
